// State allows us to manage changing data in an application. It's defined as an object where we define key-value pairs specifying various data we want to track in the application.

//Mainly we follow two types of ways to create a component {Class-based and functional}


//<p>
//The counter is correctly getting updated as you can see in the console â€“ but it's not getting updated on the UI.
//This is because we're directly updating the state inside the handleClick function as:
//this.state.counter = this.state.counter + 1
//So React does not re-render the component (and it's also a bad practice to directly update state).
//</p>

//TO make the state change react gives us a setState function which allows us to update the value of the state. {setState(updater, [callback])}

//**** Calling setState automatically re-renders the entire component and all its child components. We don't need to manually re-render */
