//React hooks are functional components with added state and lifecycle methods.
// To declare state using React Hooks, we need to use the useState hook.

// The useState hook accepts a parameter which is the initial value of the state.

// In class-based components, state is always an object. But when using useState, you can provide any value as the initial value like a number, string, boolean, object, array, null, and so on.

// The useState hook returns an array whose first value is the current value of the state. The second value is the function which we will use to update the state similar to the setState method.
